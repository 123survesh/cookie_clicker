## Simple Phaser Games

This repository was created as part of a online gamedev teaching session, that I did along with FSFTN. The session was in the language Tamil, 
so if you know the language, please do check out the videos if interested.

## How to run the games
1. Clone the repo to your computer
2. Open one of the folders, say "cookie"
3. Create a live server, to serve the contents of this folder. 
- I used python's SimpleHTTPServer, **code:** ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer:8000```
4. Open your browser (I prefer incognito mode to prevent static file caching), and go to the link: http://localhost:8000
